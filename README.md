### Two Sentence Summary
Endgame is a video game based in a post-apocalyptic fictional London 50 years after the bombs fell in 2019. The game lets you take the control of AI-Football Harold as you navigate a post-nuclear fictional London gathering intelligence from your network of football-AI spy colleagues and report to release the overseer Erik Ten Haag from his long imprisonment in a telephone box.

### Technical Summary
The core idea of Endgmae was to explore alternative control systems that tie in to the world of the game and examine how a player's perception adjusts to the affordances of their controls. The game runs using a custom built accelerometer based controller that lets the player assume the role of a ball both in game and in how they control it. The controller is built using a BNO055 9-axis accelerometer connected to an Arduino Leonardo that communicates with Unreal Engine 5.1 real-time over Serial (thanks to [Ramiro Montes De Oca](https://github.com/videofeedback)'s [SerialCOM Plugin](https://github.com/videofeedback/Unreal_Engine_SerialCOM_Plugin) for Unreal Engine).
